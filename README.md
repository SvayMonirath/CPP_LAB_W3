Group 4: [ Svay Monirath, ]

Part A:
Q. A1
CSLL:
Test No	 Duration (nanoseconds)
1	162
2	62
3	58
4	60
5	58
Average: 	80

SLL:
Test No	 Duration (nanoseconds)
1	99
2	53
3	55
4	64
5	54
Average: 	63

Evaluation: Base on stats SLL is slightly faster than CSLL, because of the size of linked list CSLL would be faster if linked list size was bigger and bigger

Q. A2
CSLL with prev:
Test No	 Duration (nanoseconds)
1	512
2	165
3	96
4	88
5	88
Average: 	189.8

CSLL without prev:
Test No	 Duration (nanoseconds)
1	200
2	172
3	106
4	80
5	126
Average: 	328.4

Evaluation: As expected having prev pointer makes deletion much faster since u donâ€™t need to traverse to find the prev if you already have it in hand

Q. A3
SLL:
Test No	 Duration (nanoseconds)
1	115
2	71
3	71
4	71
5	72
Average: 	80

CSLL:
Test No	 Duration (nanoseconds)
1	94
2	45
3	43
4	42
5	42
Average: 	53.2

Evaluation: The implementation of rotation for sll is that we basically have to make sll a temp csll then detach afterward to keep the sll style, So already have a csll makes that faster making it cost less time

Q. A4
DLL:
Test No	 Duration (nanoseconds)
1	491
2	320
3	292
4	98
5	50
Average: 	250.2

SLL:
Test No	 Duration (nanoseconds)
1	255
2	170
3	146
4	142
5	136
Average: 	169.8

Evaluation: SLL is slightly faster than DLL at deletion since in DLL u have 1 more pointer to handle making it cost more time just reconnecting

Q. A5
PUSH/POP front
SLL without tail:
Test No	 Duration (nanoseconds)
1	195
2	150
3	167
4	159
5	136
Average: 	161.4

SLL with tail:
Test No	 Duration (nanoseconds)
1	221
2	163
3	165
4	162
5	163
Average: 	174.8

Evaluation: The probable cost of without tail being faster than having tail is that the tail is useless if your just push/pop front the tail just cost more power on the CPU
PUSH/POP end
SLL without tail:
Test No	 Duration (nanoseconds)
1	754
2	287
3	270
4	196
5	214
Average: 	344.2

SLL with tail:
Test No	 Duration (nanoseconds)
1	316
2	242
3	133
4	133
5	132
Average: 	191.2

Evaluation: PUSH/POP operation on the end of the link-list makes having a tail much more useful and convenient making time faster

PUSH/POP front
DLL:
Test No	 Duration (nanoseconds)
1	329
2	157
3	124
4	161
5	108
Average: 	175.8


PUSH/POP end
DLL:
Test No	 Duration (nanoseconds)
1	274
2	149
3	122
4	119
5	168
Average: 	166.4

Evaluation: PUSH/POP on either front and back is relatively the same speed with DLL since you both have access to next and back


Q. A6

N = 1000
SLL:
Memory USAGE	 16000 bytes
Time to create	0.98 ms

DLL:
Memory USAGE	 24000  bytes
Time to create	1.39 ms

CSLL:
Memory USAGE	 16000 bytes
Time to create	0.05 ms

Evaluation:  CSLL and SLL are the same size cause of the structure of node is the same while DLL has 2 pointers and why CSLL is faster could be because of the CPU warm up , but both SLL and CSLL are roughly the same

Part B:


Q.  B1
SLL:
Test No	 Duration (nanoseconds)
1	1180
2	656
3	654
4	580
5	653
Average: 	744.6

DLL:
Test No	 Duration (nanoseconds)
1	936
2	618
3	599
4	598
5	517
Average: 	653.6

Evaluation: SLL is slower but both are the same speed this could because of the factor that DLL has prev pointer access

Q.  B2
SLL:
Test No	 Duration (nanoseconds)
1	669
2	462
3	376
4	375
5	374
Average: 	451

Vector:
Test No	 Duration (nanoseconds)
1	400
2	285
3	199
4	197
5	198
Average: 	255.6

Evaluation: Vector is increasingly faster since all operation push pop are build in and could be because of the factor of build in function was optimize better
